# Black Friday Consumer Spending Analysis

For this project, with the Thanksgiving Holiday and Black Friday around the corner, millions of shopper across the globe are setting out in the early morning to snag the best deals at local big box retailers. I have always been interested in consumer retail behavior during this annual shopping experience and how different factors such as demographics, location, income, marital status, etc. affect this consumer behavior. This Black Friday dataset from Kaggle provides consumer spending data in a retail store with 550,000 obervations consisting of these customer attributes mentioned earlier, both categorical and numerical. This will serve as sufficient sample size for many machine learning algorithms to effectively train and validate the models while still testing them on a separate partition of the dataset for an accurate analysis of its performance (RMSE).

See the Jupyter Notebook within this repo for the analysis and results.
